## Branches of Mathematics

1. **Arithmetic**:
   - Deals with basic numerical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts.

2. **Algebra**:
   - Involves unknown quantities represented by letters (e.g., $$x$$, $$y$$).
   - Generalizes formulas and rules, solving equations and inequalities.

3. **Geometry**:
   - Studies shapes, sizes, and properties of figures.
   - Includes points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids.

4. **Trigonometry**:
   - Focuses on relationships between angles and sides of triangles.
   - Essential for navigation, engineering, and physics.

5. **Calculus**:
   - Deals with rates of change and accumulation.
   - Includes concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals.

6. **Number Theory**:
   - Explores properties of integers and prime numbers.
   - Fundamental in cryptography and coding theory.

7. **Combinatorics**:
   - Concerned with counting, arrangements, and permutations.
   - Used in probability and optimization.

8. **Topology**:
   - Studies properties of space that remain unchanged under continuous deformations.
   - Focuses on concepts like continuity and compactness.

9. **Matrix Algebra**:
   - Deals with matrices, their operations, and applications.
   - Used in linear algebra, computer graphics, and data analysis.
