1. Formulate and solve mechanical engineering initial value problems of practical interest represented by first and second order differential equations using both analytical and explicit numerical methods.
2. Formulate and solve mechanical engineering boundary value problems of practical interest represented by first and second order differential equations using both analytical and explicit numerical methods.
3. Formulate and numerically solve partial differential equations.
4. Identify and implement the most appropriate numerical method for solving a specific type of engineering problem. In addition, be able to recognize the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of numerical methods.

This course combines analytical solutions to differential equations with numerical solution approaches, heavily relying on Matlab.
